# DodgeCat
A fun little game project that I work on when I'm bored, during my quest to become a less-shit programmer and learn a thing or two.

Dodge the bullets and see how long your kitty can survive.

Supports WASD, Arrow and Touch movement for mobile devices. ESC or Double Tap to Pause.

Good luck and have fun!
